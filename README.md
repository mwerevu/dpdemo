# Differential Privacy Demonstration Materials
These demonstration materials (mostly Python Notebooks) were developed by Matthew Graham to support learning basic concepts about differential privacy and some differentially private mechanisms.

These materials were developed without using any confidential data and, as such, can be distributed freely.

NOTE: These materials are provided *caveat emptor* with the responsibility on the the user to verify applicability and correctness of any implementation. Additionally, it is important that random numbers generated for differential privacy systems be cryptographically secure. No effort was made to do so in the examples presented here.
