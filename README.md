# Differential Privacy Demonstration Materials
These demonstration materials (mostly Python Notebooks) were developed by Matthew Graham to support learning basic concepts about differential privacy and some differentially private mechanisms.

These materials were developed without using any confidential data and, as such, can be distributed freely.
